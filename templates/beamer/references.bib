    abstract = { The generalized bilevel programming problem (GBLP) is a bilevel mathematical program where the lower level is a variational inequality. In this paper we prove that if the objective function of a GBLP is uniformly Lipschitz continuous in the lower level decision variable with respect to the upper level decision variable, then using certain uniform parametric error bounds as penalty functions gives single level problems equivalent to the GBLP. Several local and global uniform parametric error bounds are presented, and assumptions guaranteeing that they apply are discussed. We then derive Kuhn--Tucker-type necessary optimality conditions by using exact penalty formulations and nonsmooth analysis. }

The package is designed for solving large-scale, smooth nonlinear programming problems, and it is also effective for the following special cases: unconstrained optimization, nonlinear systems of equations, least squares, and linear and quadratic programming. Various algorithmic options are available, including two interior methods and an active-set method. The package provides crossover techniques between algorithmic options as well as automatic selection of options and settings.",

In addition the assumptions made on the technologies of producers and the tastes of consumers are significantly weaker than Wald's. Finally a simplification of the structure of the proofs has been made possible through use of the concept of an abstract economy, a generalization of that of a game.},

              with more than 60 new exercises and new material on varioustopics,

abstract = { Abstract. In this paper we study a pollution regulation problem in an electricity market with a network structure. The market is ruled by an independent system operator (ISO) who has the goal of reducing the pollutant emissions of the providers in the network by encouraging the use of cleaner technologies. The problem of the ISO formulates as a contracting problem with each one of the providers, who interact among themselves by playing a stochastic differential game. The actions of the providers are not observable by the ISO which faces the moral hazard. By using the dynamic programming approach, we represent the value function of the ISO as the unique viscosity solution to the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. We prove that this solution is smooth and characterize the optimal controls for the ISO. Numerical solutions to the problem are presented and discussed. We consider also a simpler problem for the ISO, with constant production levels, that can be solved explicitly in a particular setting. }

abstract = {Standard models of pollution abatement assume that pollution accumulation occurs in a deterministic pattern as a by-product of the production process. Governmental intervention often occurs in the form of taxation or mandatory abatement controls to reduce inefficiency caused by incomplete markets. In this paper we assume that the accumulation effect of pollution may be stochastic due, for instance, to the random absorption capacity of the ecosystem. Furthermore, we assume that the level of pollution may vary with input use as well as output level. We proceed to analyze properties of a policy for efficient social management of competitive firms which generate pollution.}
